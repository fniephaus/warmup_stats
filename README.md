# warmup_stats

This system has various scripts for analysing the output of VM benchmarking. Any
system can be used to perform the benchmarking, e.g.
[Krun](http://soft-dev.org/src/krun/).

# Installation

First run the `build.sh` script which should perform most, if not all, of the
installation work needed.

# Basic usage

User should directly call the `bin/warmup_stats`, which is a front-end to other
scripts in `bin/`. `warmup_stats` takes either CSV files or
[Krun](http://soft-dev.org/src/krun/) results files as input. As output it can
create HTML or LaTeX / PDF tables and diffs, or PDF plots.

## CSV format

The `bin/warmup_stats` script can take CSV files as input. The format is as
follows. The first row must contain a header with a process execution id,
benchmark name and sequence of iteration numbers. Subsequent rows are data rows,
one per process execution. Each row should contain an index for the given
process execution, the benchmark name and a list of times in seconds for the
corresponding in-process iteration. Each process execution must execute the same
number of iterations as described in the header. For example:

```
    process_exec_num, bench_name, 0, 1, 2, ...
    0, spectral norm, 0.2, 0.1, 0.4, ...
    1, spectral norm, 0.3, 0.15, 0.2, ...
```

When processing CSV files with `warmup_stats`, the `--language`, `--vm` and
`--uname` switches must be passed to the script. These are not needed with
Krun results files.

## Creating plots

The `--output-plots <file.pdf>` flag converts input data into visual plots.

If the input files are in CSV format, `bin/warmup_stats` also needs the names of
the language and VM under test, and the output of `uname -a` on the machine the
benchmarks were run on.

Example usage:

```
bin/warmup_stats  --output-plots plots.pdf --output-json summary.json -l javascript -v V8 -u "`uname -a`" results.csv
bin/warmup_stats  --output-plots plots.pdf --output-json summary.json results.json.bz2
```

## Creating tables

The `--output-table <file>` flag converts input data into an HTML table or a
LaTeX / PDF table. Conversion to PDF requires `pdflatex` to be installed.

If the input files are in CSV format, `bin/warmup_stats` also needs the names of
the language and VM under test, and the output of `uname -a` on the machine the
benchmarks were run on.

Example usage (LaTeX / PDF):

```
bin/warmup_stats --tex --output-table table.tex -l javascript -v V8 -u "`uname -a`" results.csv
bin/warmup_stats --tex --output-table table.tex results.json.bz2
```

Example usage (HTML):

```
bin/warmup_stats --html --output-table table.html -l javascript -v V8 -u "`uname -a`" results.csv
bin/warmup_stats --html --output-table table.html results.json.bz2
```

## Creating diffs

Benchmarking is often performed in order to test whether a change in a given
VM improves or worsens its performance. Unfortunately, the difference between
benchmark performance before and after a change is rarely simple. Users will
want to produce a detailed comparison of the results in Krun results tables
(above) in order to get a deeper insight into the effects of their changes.

The `--output-diff` flag converts data from exactly two CSV files into an HTML
table or a LaTeX / PDF table. Conversion to PDF requires `pdflatex` to be
installed.

If the input files are in CSV format, `bin/warmup_stats` also needs the names of
the language and VM under test, and the output of `uname -a` on the machine the
benchmarks were run on.

Example usage (LaTeX / PDF):

```
bin/warmup_stats --tex --output-diff diff.tex -l javascript -v V8 -u "`uname -a`" before.csv after.csv
bin/warmup_stats --tex --output-diff diff.tex before.json.bz2 after.json.bz2
```

Example usage (HTML):

```
bin/warmup_stats --html --output-diff diff.html -l javascript -v V8 -u "`uname -a`" before.csv after.csv
bin/warmup_stats --html --output-diff diff.html before.json.bz2 after.json.bz2
```

The resulting table will contain results from the `after.{csv,json.bz2}` file,
compared against the `before.{csv,json.bz2}` file. VMs and benchmarks that do
not appear in both CSV results files will be omitted from the table.
